## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this SDK, please send an email to [security@hyperliquid.xyz]. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please do not disclose security-related issues publicly until they have been handled by the maintainers.

## Security Considerations

When using this SDK:

1. **API Keys**: Never hardcode API keys in your source code. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.
2. **Private Keys**: Keep your private keys secure and never commit them to version control.
3. **Network Security**: Always use HTTPS endpoints when available.
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices

- Use the latest version of the SDK
- Regularly update dependencies
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use proper error handling
